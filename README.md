# PAWL-E ACM Robot Graphics

This repository contains a graphical program created using the ACM Graphics library to display a robot structure named PAWL-E. The project demonstrates how to use `GCompound`, `GRoundRect`, `GOval`, `GLabel`, `GImage`, and other graphical elements to make a robot figure with custom colors and dimensions.

## PAWL-E Features

- **Robot Structure**: Built using multiple shapes (rectangles, ovals) and images.
- **Custom Colors**: The robot uses specific colors, such as `PACIFIC_ORANGE`, `PACIFIC_DARK_ORANGE`, and `PACIFIC_YELLOW`.
- **Robot Elements**: Includes arms, legs, hands, body, head, and a label to represent the robot in the middle.
- **Centered Layout**: The robot structure is centered within the application window, calculated based on the screen size.

## PAWL-E Project Structure

- **ACMLab.java**: The main class where the robot structure is defined and displayed.
- **Constants**: All dimensions and colors are defined as constants for easy customization.
- **Helper Methods**: Functions like `getRect()` and `getOval()` are used to simplify shape creation.

## PAWL-E Robot Requirements

- **ACM Java Graphics Library**: Ensure you have the ACM library set up in your Java project.
